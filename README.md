# SwiftSchoolDemo
4 Demo Apps for my Swift intro in school

SwiftUIMVVM - Is a demo app for SwiftUI and the MVVM pattern
ARNumbers - Is an Augmented Reality App, showing a virtual cube that counts numbers up and down
FlappyClone and FlappyCloneSwiftUI - Are Flappy Bird clone apps, one in UIKit, the other one in SwiftUI
FlowerClassifierSwiftUI - is an App which uses a CoreML pretrained model to classify flowers

All apps run on an iPhone and - except the FlappyClone UIKit version - also on an iPad (using Swift Playgrounds)

The Flower Model can't be trained on an iPad though, so the pretrained Model needs to be imported in Swift Playgrounds.
That's a bit tricky (because you also need an autogenerated bridging file), so I wrote a small HOWTO in the forIpad folder within the ML folder in the FlowerClassifierSiwftUI App.

I hope you have fun with it and can learn something.
Cheers.
